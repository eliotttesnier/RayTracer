![Cubes](Cubes.png)

**Description:**
This render showcases **reflection** and **transparency**.
At the center, a **Rubik's Cube** (made with multiple squares) sits above a **chess-patterned ground plane** that also reflects its surroundings. Two **blue transparent Tanglecubes** fly around the Rubik's Cube.
Lighting two **white point lights**, and a **bluish ambient** for subtle tone. The result is rendered in **4K** with **adaptive antialiasing**, **Phong lighting**, and **ambient occlusion**.
