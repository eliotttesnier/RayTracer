Rendering uses **adaptive antialiasing**, **Phong shading**, and **ambient occlusion**, at **4K resolution** with a **70° field of view**.

**✅ Demonstrated Features:**

- Plane with file texture (dirt/earth) and reflection
- Texturing from image files
- Phong lighting model
- Ambient occlusion
- Adaptive antialiasing
- 4K camera resolution, FOV 70°
