![Infinite Refraction](InfiniteRefraction.png)

**Description:**
This render highlights complex **refraction** and **transparency** effects using infinite primitives.
A **chess-patterned ground plane** with reflection and a **gray wall** set the scene. At the center, a **light blue infinite cone** refracts and transmits light, intersected by two **infinite cylinders** ‚Äî one **orange**, crossing laterally, and one **green**, cutting through diagonally.
Lighting and shading emphasize the interaction between transparent surfaces and their environment.
