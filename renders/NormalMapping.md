![Normal Mapping](NormalMapping.png)

**Description:**
This render showcases the use of **normal maps** to add fine surface detail without increasing geometric complexity.
The scene features a **ground plane** with a rugged canyon-like normal map and subtle reflection, and two **spheres**: one with a **metallic normal map**, the other with a **tiled pattern**. A **white wall plane** serves as background.
Multiple light sources interact with the normals to highlight surface variations.

**‚úÖ Demonstrated Features:**
- Normal mapping:
  - Ground plane (canyon/earth texture)
  - Sphere (metallic texture)
  - Sphere (tiled texture)
- Reflective surface (ground)
- Multiple point lights (blue & yellow)
- Multiple directional lights (white)
- Ambient white light
- Phong lighting model
- Ambient occlusion
- Adaptive antialiasing
- 4K camera resolution, FOV 70¬∞
